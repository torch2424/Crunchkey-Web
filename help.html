		<p> If you are having trouble recieving the correct answer, please keep in mind operations are calculated from left to right.
			Meaning that, the expresssion 4+5*9, will be calculated as 4+5 = 9, and then 9*9 = 81. This is done for faster calculation,
			as if we were to do it the other way, you would have to copy and paste your answer, and you could not simply perform
			another operation on the current answer. However, if you did decide that you need a certain part of the expression to happen
			before another, you could add parantheses around your desired part of the expression. For example, simply turn 4+5*9 into
			4+(5*9) to get the answer 49. Thank you for using CrunchKey, and happy calculating!</p>
